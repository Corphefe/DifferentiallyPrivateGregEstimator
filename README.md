# DifferentiallyPrivateGregEstimator
NSERC Undergraduate Research Award Project

This Repository contains my final submitted result from my NSERC USRA Summer Research Project (2025). I was awarded an Undergraduate Research grant by the Canadian Government to do reserach in applications of Differential Privacy in Model Assisted Survey Estimators. 

Differential Privacy (DP) is a formalization and method of measuring how "private" statistical query releases from a database are. The goal of privatisation is to release useful statisitcal query answers about a database while protecting the specfic information of members of the dataset.

Applied to Sampling Theory, we have to consider defining what exactly is the database we are protecting in this setting, how to privatise exisitng statistics, and how well the privatised versions preform. In particular, I looked at privatising the Generalised Regression Estimator (GREG) by construcitng 3 potential privatisation methods. My theory and results are detailed in FinalReportNSERC.pdf, while the specfic algorithms implemented are in the attached .R files.

My supervisor Prof. Mehdi Dagdoug, and Hui-Shen may continue work on this topic.
